 # Project Overview

 At the core of our system lies the ESP32 CAM and LCD display, meticulously integrated to provide real-time distance measurements and alerts to drivers navigating challenging ghat road curves. Leveraging my expertise in Python programming, I crafted a robust solution that seamlessly combines object detection using YOLO and OpenCV, along with ultrasonic sensors for precise distance calculations.

# How It Works:

As a vehicle approaches a ghat road curve, our system springs into action, detecting the vehicle with remarkable accuracy using YOLO's advanced object detection capabilities. The ESP32 CAM captures real-time footage, while OpenCV processes the data to determine the vehicle's distance from the curve. This information is relayed to the LCD display, where drivers are presented with clear distance indicators, empowering them to make informed decisions.

Furthermore, to ensure visibility and alertness, LED indicators strategically placed on both sides of the road change color based on the vehicle's proximity to the curve. This intuitive visual cue serves as an additional safety measure, enhancing situational awareness for drivers.

Moreover, our system doesn't stop there. By integrating a user-friendly web interface, travelers and road authorities alike can access real-time road conditions and incoming traffic data remotely. This level of accessibility revolutionizes road safety management, empowering stakeholders to proactively address potential hazards and optimize traffic flow.
